## Synopsis

NOT READY FOR REUSE.  THIS IS A TRAINING EXERCISE ONLY.  ONLY THE WBDDATA PART WORKS

Python Django Rest Framework API implementation 
of the Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) and Watershed Boundary Dataset.  Provides a
complete API to navigate the HUC/WBD dataset(s) in JSON and XML formats.

Two sample clients are also included. 'Chart' provides a D3js implementation of 
a WBD browser. 'Map' provides a map-based implementation of a WBD navigation too. 

## Code Example

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors
